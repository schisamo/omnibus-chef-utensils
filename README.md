# Omnibus Chef Utensils

A self-contained, full-stack cookbook development toolchain for Chef!

The current version of the Chef Utensils toolchain is bundled with:

* Ruby 1.9.3
* [Chef 11](https://github.com/opscode/chef) (`knife` and `chef-shell` a Chef developers best friends)
* [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) (cookbook dependency management; it's like Bundler for your cookbooks)
* [Foodcritic](http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/) (A lint tool for your cookbooks.)
* [Test Kitchen 1.0](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/tree/1.0) (n√©e Jamie-CI; multi-platform
integration testing made easy)

Additionally the following Knife plugins are included:

* knife-ec2
* knife-openstack
* knife-rackspace

## Quick Start

Creating an Omnibus-powered Chef Utensils package is easy! Assuming you have a
sane Ruby development environment configured, run the following commands on the
platform you want to build a package for:

```
bundle install --binstubs
cp omnibus.rb.example omnibus.rb
sudo mkdir -p /opt/chef-utensils /var/cache/omnibus
sudo chown $USER:staff /opt/chef-utensils /var/cache/omnibus
bundle exec omnibus build project chef-utensils
```

This repository also ships with a Vagrantfile which makes it easy to build
packages for most major Linux distributions. Simply uncomment out the
appropriate Vagrant box entry in the Vagrantfile and run:

```
bundle install --binstubs
bundle exec vagrant up
```

No matter the method you choose, once your build is complete you should have
a shiny new platform-specific package sitting at `$PWD/pkg`. Take that package
and share with your friends and co-workers. Ideally you would build these
packages in some sort of CI infrastructure and have build slaves for each
platform you want to support.

## Supported Platforms

Rough build vs install compatibility matrix for Linux distributions:

| Build Platform         | Compatible Install Platforms                    |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit    | Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10, 11.04, 11.10 64-bit        |
| Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit    | Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10 64-bit                      |
| CentOS 5 64-bit        | RHEL 5 derivatives (Fedora, Amazon, Scientific) |
| CentOS 6 64-bit        | RHEL 6 derivatives (Fedora, Amazon, Scientific) |
| Mac OS X 10.8.2 64-bit | Mac OS X 10.8.2 64-bit (Mountain Lion)          |

Additionally packages created on Ubuntu should install on Debain. The above
matrix is based on known compatibility from Chef Omnibus packages.

## TODO

* Windows MSI support
* Add support for installing to user home directory (ie ~/chef-utensils )
* Add support to prompt, download and install Vagrant full-stack installer
* Add support to prompt, download and install VirtualBox
* Help user setup initial knife.rb file
* Add acceptance tests to ensure all packaged utilities play nicely with each
other.
